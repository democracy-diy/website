	<li><b>3/15/2025</b>: <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr1968">H.R.1968</a> guaranteed $535 million for PBS and NPR for 2027 (years 2025–2026 were already funded), after <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h70">passing the House</a> and <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s133">passing the Senate</a>.</li>
	<li><b>5/01/2025</b>: Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ending-taxpayer-subsidization-of-biased-media/">executive order</a> to immediately cease all federal funding for PBS and NPR. The money is still appropriated, but won’t be paid. Similar executive orders have been ruled to be illegal in federal court.</li>
	<li><b>7/17/2025</b>: <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr4">H.R.4</a>, which would remove all previously-allocated funding for PBS and NPR, <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h168">passed the House</a>, <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s411">passed the Senate with changes</a>, and is now back in the House.
	<li><b>GOAL</b>: Congress must keep appropriations for PBS and NPR in the budget. Federal courts must order Trump to release the funds.</li>
