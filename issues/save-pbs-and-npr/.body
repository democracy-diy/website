<p>On May 1, Trump signed an executive order to immediately cease all federal funding for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS">PBS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR">NPR</a>.
This will cut $535 million in annual federal funding, which is less than <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61172">0.008% of the federal budget</a>, but <a href="https://foundation.pbs.org/ways-to-give/gifts-to-the-pbs-endowment-fund/">15% of the PBS budget</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366040/npr-federal-funding-katherine-maher">1% of the NPR budget</a>.</p>

<p>Local stations will also have their federal funding cut, and they rely on it <i>extensively</i>, for everything from educational programs and music to satellite service and emergency alert systems.</p>

<p>Funding shortages are expected to cause <b>program cancellations</b> and <b>station shutdowns</b>—especially in rural areas—as financial reserves dwindle.</p>


<h2>Why it matters</h2>

<p>This is part of a larger <b>attack on the freedom of the press</b>.
We need an independent media or we will lose our ability to discern fact from fiction.</p>

<p><b>PBS and NPR play a vital role</b> in our democracy and community life, from broadcasting emergency information during natural disasters to teaching our kids the ABCs on <i>Sesame Street</i>.
They are a lifeline of information and civic engagement—often the only outlets providing local news, educational kids’ shows, and cultural programming free from corporate and political agendas.</p>
