<p>Trump is attempting to gain control of the USPS by placing two personal allies on the USPS board of governors:</p>

<ul class="text">
	<li><b>Anthony Lomangino (R)</b>: a Mar-a-Lago donor who donated nearly $9 million into a Trump super PAC, and paid legal bills for Trump allies who were under federal investigation.</li>
	<li><b>John LaValle (R)</b>: a long-time GOP party member with deep ties to MAGA politics.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://origin.nalc.org/government-affairs/legislative-updates/president-trump-sends-two-usps-bog-nominees-to-senate">The USPS board of governors is meant to be politically neutral</a>:
The board currently has two Republicans, two Democrats, and one Independent, with four vacant seats.
The Senate typically considers nominations in bipartisan pairs—a Republican and a Democrat—to maintain this neutral balance.</p>

<p>However, Trump wants to appoint <i>two Republican allies</i>, giving him complete control over the board.</p>

<p>Trump’s larger goal is to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/business/trump-postal-service-privatization">privatize mail delivery</a>, turning it into a for-profit business rather a guaranteed public service.
He claims that the current system is “unsustainable,” despite the USPS reporting a <a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2025/0206-usps-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-results.htm">$144 million profit</a> during the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>The Trump administration is considering <b>reducing the number of delivery days</b>, <b>ending door service</b> (forcing people to go to the post office to pick up their mail), and <b>closing post offices</b> in less-profitable areas.</p>

<p>Wells Fargo predicts that shipping costs will rise by at least <a href="https://usmailnotforsale.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Wells-Fargo-USPS-Privatization-A-Framework.pdf">~30%–140%</a>.
The loss of competition with USPS may drive prices up still higher—and this is <i>before</i> the additional fees that FedEx and UPS are already charging for the less-profitable ZIP codes where <a href="https://ips-dc.org/who-would-pay-the-biggest-price-for-postal-privatization/">102 million Americans</a> live.</p>

<p>Widespread reductions in service are expected.
Less-profitable neighborhoods, including rural areas and indigenous nations, may lose access to mail delivery, including packages, prescription medication, and vote-by-mail ballots.</p>

<p>The USPS is one of the most popular parts of the federal government, with a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/12/americans-see-many-federal-agencies-favorably-but-republicans-grow-more-critical-of-justice-department/">72% approval rating</a>, and is essential to many communities.
The USPS exists to serve <i>everyone</i>, in <i>every</i> ZIP code, without regard to profit—which is what sets it apart from private companies.</p>
