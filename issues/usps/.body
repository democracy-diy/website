<p>Trump would like to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/business/trump-postal-service-privatization">privatize mail delivery</a>, turning it into a for-profit business rather a guaranteed public service.
He claims that the current system is “unsustainable,” despite the USPS reporting a <a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2025/0206-usps-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-results.htm">$144 million profit</a> during the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>The Trump administration is considering: <b>reducing</b> the number of delivery days, <b>ending</b> door service (forcing people to go to the post office to pick up their mail), and <b>eliminating</b> the post offices in less-profitable areas.</p>

<p>Widespread reductions in service are expected.
Rural areas, indigenous nations, and less-profitable neighborhoods will likely lose access to mail delivery, including packages, prescription medication, and vote-by-mail ballots.</p>

<p>The USPS is one of the most popular parts of the federal government, with a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/12/americans-see-many-federal-agencies-favorably-but-republicans-grow-more-critical-of-justice-department/">72% approval rating</a>, and is essential to many communities.
The USPS exists to serve <i>everyone</i>, in <i>every</i> ZIP code, without regard to profit.
This sets the USPS apart from private companies who have no interest in serving addresses where they would lose money.</p>

<p>Trump is attempting to gain control of the USPS by placing two personal allies on the USPS board of governors:</p>

<ul class="text">
	<li><b>Anthony Lomangino (R)</b> is a Mar-a-Lago donor who poured nearly $9 million into a Trump super PAC, and paid legal bills for Trump allies who were under federal investigation.</li>
	<li><b>John LaValle (R)</b> is a long-time GOP party boss with deep ties to MAGA politics.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://origin.nalc.org/government-affairs/legislative-updates/president-trump-sends-two-usps-bog-nominees-to-senate">The USPS board of governors is meant to be politically neutral</a>:
The board currently has two Republicans, two Democrats, and one Independent, with four vacant seats.
The Senate typically considers nominations in bipartisan pairs—a Republican and a Democrat—to maintain this neutral balance.</p>

<p>However, Trump wants to appoint <i>two Republican allies</i>, giving him complete control over the board, which would allow him to upend the USPS from within.</p>
