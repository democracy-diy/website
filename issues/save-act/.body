<p>The SAVE Act (<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr22">H.R.22</a>/<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s128">S.128</a>)
means roughly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5301676/save-act-explainer-voter-registration">20–90 million Americans</a> will no longer be able to register to vote.</p>

<p>Here’s what could happen under the SAVE Act:</p>

<ul class="text">
	<li>When you try to register online, you’ll find that online registration has been taken down: you now need to register in person.</li>
	<li>When you take time off work to come in with your REAL ID, you’ll find that your REAL ID no longer works: you now need a birth certificate.</li>
	<li>When you return with your birth certificate, you’ll find that your birth certificate is not accepted: because you’re one of 69 million people who changed their name after marriage, you now need a name-change document.</li>
	<li>After requesting a name-change document from the county clerk, you return to find that you will not be able to register to vote. The registration deadline has passed.</li>
</ul>
