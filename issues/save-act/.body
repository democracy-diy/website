<p>The SAVE Act (<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr22">H.R.22</a>/<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s128">S.128</a>)
means roughly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5301676/save-act-explainer-voter-registration">20–90 million Americans</a> will no longer be able to register to vote.</p>

<p>Here’s what could happen to you after your next move, under the SAVE Act:</p>

<ul class="text">
	<li>If you try to register online, you’ll find that online registration has been taken down: you need to register in person under the new rules.</li>
	<li>If you come in during work hours with your REAL ID ready to go, you’re told that a REAL ID is no longer enough. You now need a birth certificate.</li>
	<li>If you find your birth certificate and come back, you’re told that your birth certificate will not be accepted. Because you’re one of 69 million people who changed their name after marriage, you now need a name-change document.</li>
	<li>If you request the name-change document from the county clerk, and receive it, and return, you’re told that you will not be able to register to vote. While you were navigating the various obstacles, the registration deadline has passed.</li>
</ul>
